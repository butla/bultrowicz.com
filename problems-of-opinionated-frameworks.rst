Bad, because opinions can, and SHOULD (when provided with a strong case) change.
You can't not make things opinionated. But you can facilitate other opinions explicitly.
Ying yang, order chaos. The condition (or catalyst?) of dialectic evolution.

Being less opinionated, more vast and multifaceted causes anxiety, true.
But only by withstanding that anxiety we can grow (the scene from Dune, only in the movie).
I guess not everyone needs to grow, but it's definitely better for them if they do.
Also Peterson's work.
