<p>You're thinking of using my services? That's great :) Just be aware I have some terms:</p>
<ol>
<li>We can have different modes of working together:
<ul>
<li>time allocation
<ul>
<li>daily rate: 500 GBP/day; full-time possible</li>
<li>hourly rate: 90 GBP/h; flexible hours</li>
</ul></li>
<li>milestone-based
<ul>
<li>We set up milestones for the project together
<ul>
<li>This meeting is free if it's online and doesn't take more than 2 hours. Every hour above 2 is charged with my hourly rate.</li>
<li>This can be a face-to-face meeting</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I get back to you with the price of each milestone (starting at 1000 GBP)
<ul>
<li>Only the first few milestones will have a fixed price.</li>
<li>Milestones that are further in the future will have estimates that might change as we get further into the project, because then new information will surely appear.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>we have regular progress update meetings:
<ul>
<li>We do them so that you know I'm on track, and so that I fill in the gaps in understanding of what it is that you really want.</li>
<li>We don't need to do them if chat or email is enough for both of us.</li>
<li>They can take as long as they need to.</li>
<li>I'd prefer them to take place every 2 to 5 workdays. They can be everyday if that's necessary and if the development pace will be high enough.</li>
<li>I will charge you my hourly fee if I notice you start abusing the meetings to squeeze in more consultations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I invoice for the milestones upon their delivery (we define what "delivery" means for each of them).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Contract type
<ul>
<li>B2B only. I'm not interested in regular employment.</li>
<li>Remote only, with occasional face-to-face meetings.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rates and currency
<ul>
<li>VAT needs to be added to all the rates.</li>
<li>Instead of paying me with GBP, you can pay the equivalent in EUR, USD, or PLN.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Invoicing
<ul>
<li>I can issue invoices as a UK or EU (Polish) limited company.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Face-to-face meetings.
<ul>
<li>It might be good to have those every now and then (not more often than once every two weeks), or at the start of the project.</li>
<li>I can travel anywhere you need me, as long as there's no quarantine for a vaccinated person traveling from Poland.</li>
<li>On-site visits can't be longer than 5 workdays in a row.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Recruiters - I might ignore your message if you don't include "lorem ipsum" in its text to prove that you've read the above.</p>
