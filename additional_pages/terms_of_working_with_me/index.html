<p>You're thinking of using my services? Great :) Just be aware I have some terms:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>You won't have 100% of my attention, I might not be available to you every workday. I will be working on other projects. You'll probably still be amazed at the results, though.</p></li>
<li>Possible modes of working together:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A monthly fee of 4000 GBP + VAT, or the equivalent in EUR, USD, or PLN (you should add &quot; + VAT, or the equivalent in EUR, USD, or PLN&quot; to all the prices below).</li>
<li>Consultations paid by the hour (100 GBP/h).</li>
<li>600 GBP/day, max two days a week.</li>
<li>Milestone-based.
<ul>
<li>We set up milestones for the project together
<ul>
<li>This meeting is free if it's online and doesn't take more than 2 hours. Every hour above 2 costs 100 GBP.</li>
<li>This can be a face-to-face meeting, but the terms from paragraph 5 apply.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I get back to you with the price of each milestone (starting at 1000 GBP)
<ul>
<li>Only the first few milestones will have a fixed price.</li>
<li>Milestones that are further in the future will have estimates that might change as we get further into the project, because then new information will surely appear.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I invoice for the milestones upon their delivery (we define what &quot;delivery&quot; means for each of them).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Progress update meetings.
<ul>
<li>We do them so that you know I'm on track, and so that I fill in the gaps in understanding of what you want.</li>
<li>We don't need to do them if chat or email is enough for both of us.</li>
<li>They can take as long as they need to.</li>
<li>I'd prefer them to take place every 2 to 5 workdays. They can be everyday if that's necessary and if the development pace will be high enough.</li>
<li>I will charge you my hourly fee if I notice you start abusing the meetings to squeeze in more consultations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>B2B only. I can issue invoices as a UK or EU (Polish) limited company.</p></li>
<li>Face-to-face or on-site meetings.
<ul>
<li>It might be good to have those every now and then, or at the start of the project.</li>
<li>They cost 100 GBP per hour, plus my travel expenses.</li>
<li>I can travel anywhere you need me, as long as there's no quarantine for a vaccinated person traveling from Poland.</li>
<li>On-site visits can't be longer than 5 workdays in a row.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
