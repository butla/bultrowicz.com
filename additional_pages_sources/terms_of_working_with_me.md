You're thinking of using my services? Great :)
Just be aware I have some terms:

1. You won't have 100% of my attention, I might not be available to you every workday. I will be working on other projects. You'll probably still be amazed at the results, though.

2. Possible modes of working together:
    1. A monthly fee of 4000 GBP + VAT, or the equivalent in EUR, USD, or PLN (you should add " + VAT, or the equivalent in EUR, USD, or PLN" to all the prices below).
    2. Consultations paid by the hour (100 GBP/h).
    3. 600 GBP/day, max two days a week.
    4. Milestone-based.
        - We set up milestones for the project together
            - This meeting is free if it's online and doesn't take more than 2 hours. Every hour above 2 costs 100 GBP.
            - This can be a face-to-face meeting, but the terms from paragraph 5 apply.
        - I get back to you with the price of each milestone (starting at 1000 GBP)
            - Only the first few milestones will have a fixed price.
            - Milestones that are further in the future will have estimates that might change as we get further into the project, because then new information will surely appear.
        - I invoice for the milestones upon their delivery (we define what "delivery" means for each of them).

3. Progress update meetings.
    - We do them so that you know I'm on track, and so that I fill in the gaps in understanding of what you want.
    - We don't need to do them if chat or email is enough for both of us.
    - They can take as long as they need to.
    - I'd prefer them to take place every 2 to 5 workdays. They can be everyday if that's necessary and if the development pace will be high enough.
    - I will charge you my hourly fee if I notice you start abusing the meetings to squeeze in more consultations.

4. B2B only. I can issue invoices as a UK or EU (Polish) limited company.

5. Face-to-face or on-site meetings.
    - It might be good to have those every now and then, or at the start of the project.
    - They cost 100 GBP per hour, plus my travel expenses.
    - I can travel anywhere you need me, as long as there's no quarantine for a vaccinated person traveling from Poland.
    - On-site visits can't be longer than 5 workdays in a row.

Recruiters - I will ignore your message if you don't include "lorem ipsum" in its text to prove that you've read the above.
