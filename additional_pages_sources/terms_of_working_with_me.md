You're thinking of using my services? That's great :)
Just be aware I have some terms:

1. We can have different modes of working together:
    - time allocation
        - daily rate: 550 GBP/day; full-time possible
        - hourly rate: 100 GBP/h; flexible hours
    - milestone-based
        - We set up milestones for the project together
            - This meeting is free if it's online and doesn't take more than 2 hours.
              Every hour above 2 is charged with my hourly rate.
            - This can be a face-to-face meeting
        - I get back to you with the price of each milestone (starting at 1000 GBP)
            - Only the first few milestones will have a fixed price.
            - Milestones that are further in the future will have estimates that might change as we get further
              into the project, because then new information will surely appear.
        - we have regular progress update meetings:
            - We do them so that you know I'm on track, and so that I fill in the gaps in understanding of what it is
            that you really want.
            - We don't need to do them if chat or email is enough for both of us.
            - They can take as long as they need to.
            - I'd prefer them to take place every 2 to 5 workdays.
              They can be everyday if that's necessary and if the development pace will be high enough.
            - I will charge you my hourly fee if I notice you start abusing the meetings to squeeze in
              more consultations.
        - I invoice for the milestones upon their delivery (we define what "delivery" means for each of them).

2. Contract type
    - B2B only. I'm not interested in regular employment.

3. Rates and currency
    - All rates will have VAT included.
    - Instead of paying me with GBP, you can pay the equivalent in EUR or USD.

4. Invoicing
    - I can issue invoices as a UK or EU (Polish) limited company.

5. Face-to-face meetings.
    - It might be good to have those every now and then (not more often than once every two weeks), or at the start of the project.
    - I can travel anywhere you need me, as long as there's no quarantine for a vaccinated person traveling from Poland.
    - On-site visits can't be longer than 5 workdays in a row.

Recruiters - I might ignore your message if you don't include "lorem ipsum" in its text to prove that you've read the above.
