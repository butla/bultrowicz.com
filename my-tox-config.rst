My oppressive Tox config
========================

I like to keep my projects (and its developers, including me) under control.
Besides, it's really nice to have this one thing that tells you that everything is OK
(or that it's definitely NOT OK) if you want to keep your sanity.

Może kolejny post o moim setupie w Toxie i rzeczach, które sprawdzam?
I like when my tests keep the developers (only me, in this case) in check, so my tox configuration not only runs my tests,
but also checks that test coverage is at 100% and that there are no unknown Pylint issues.
