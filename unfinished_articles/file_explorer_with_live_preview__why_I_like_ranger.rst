Files are a great simple way of communication. Both process-to-process, and process-to-human.

The ideas of files and folders/directories seems to fit into the heads
of more people than modern crowded web UIs.

So it's really neat that file explorers like ranger (written in Python) and its clone (I don't use it)
have that feature. I hope more file explorers will. If windows can show you image previews, why can't it
show text previews? (even better if you could copy from them).
Even better if ranger could embed editors like neovim so we can edit the files on the fly.
Weeeel, you can easily jump into vim. But then you lose track of the files. And maybe have to open nerdtree.
Or play with tmux like I do.

At least for people who aren't very adapted to using a computer or a smartphone.
If more file explorers supported that then it'd be more acceptable for more programs
to communicate with the human like that. Which would be great for the devs and users,
since it's easier to maintain quality (by really thorough testing) of an app that communicates with files
rather than a GUI one.
