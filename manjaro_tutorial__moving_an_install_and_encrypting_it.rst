I've put a tweaked version of my previous post (:ref:`moving_a_linux_install_to_a_new_drive_and_encrypting_it`)
up on Manjaro forums as a tutorial.
You can check it out `here <https://forum.manjaro.org/t/moving-an-installation-to-a-different-drive-and-encrypting-it-with-luks-a-guide/80304>`_.

The differences between that tutorial and my original post:
- more info about the partition for ``/boot``
- more hand-holding for the case of your computer being able to hold two drives
- cut out the mentions of potential command differences between distributions
- cut out more personal notes
