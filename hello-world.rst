Yay! It's yet another blog about Python, software development in general,
technology and other related stuff!

Well, at least it's going to be about these things, because right now it's
just this one post about nothing... But rest assured that real articles will
soon follow :-) 

Oh and if you're interested, I created this blog with
`Ablog <http://ablog.readthedocs.io/>`_ and I'm currently using the default
`Alabaster theme <https://github.com/bitprophet/alabaster>`_.
At one point I want to redo the style, but we'll see how it goes.
