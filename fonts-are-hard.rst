Fonts are hard

So I've yet to publish the first article (it's comming, seriously) when some of my friends told me
that the fonts on my blog look ugly.
They had a strange issue with only italics being installed of the old goudy (on Windows).

I had two different fonts in Chrome and Firefox on Xubuntu, because they've both used their default
serif font (Liberation Serif and Deja Vu Serif, respectively).

So I wanted the look to not change much, but I've liked Liberation Serif.
It should be a free replacement for Times New Roman, so I've settled on it.

I know it's kind of embarassing to use the default Microsoft Word font for your site,
but I find it good on the eyes.
I wanted a serif font, because they are good for reading texts.
Like on Kindle, in papers done with LaTeX, etc.
The letters are quite big, so they should be fine for reading in serif.
But on the other hand, Chrome kind of does get them small.
Maybe sans for the text?
But then, wouldn't it be better to have the same font?
