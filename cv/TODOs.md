# CV TODOs

Change "computer skills" into a list with years of experience.
Note with which tools I worked where and for how long?

Put the stuff from "computer skills" that don't just translate into years of work into the "summary".

What about "team leadership" for about a year?

## Tools experience (TODO remove some stuff from skills, maybe all, or leave main focus areas)
Say how much where
