Iterio:

- was the main python guy.
 First made some scripts more maintainable, 
 rewrote them with proper python restructured for testability and added the tests.
- I learned a lot about silicon valley-type tech startup business (and what the "data" companies make money on)
- learned the value of good services and tools - being able to run this whole huge thing with just 3 people.

My communication style: direct, open, striving for ego-less.
If we are to make amazing things happen together, we need to be aware of many things.
We need lots of accurate data to make good predictions and chart a course.
So I'm all for being truthful.
