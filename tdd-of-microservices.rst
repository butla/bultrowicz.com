This year at EuroPython (and not only there), I gave a
`talk about Test Driven Development of Python microservices`_.
I guess you can check it out, if you're into that kind of stuff.
It's also available `in Polish`_.

I also wrote an `article based on the talk`_ for PyConPL and I will be chopping
and adjusting it into a series of (hopefully) small blog posts, so stay tuned.
